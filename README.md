As devoted dog owners and lovers we wanted to make it simple for you to find your new fury best friend from a shelter in the Greater Richmond area. As we all know dogs can come in all shapes and sizes with different tempermeants and physical activity needs. When trying to find your new best friend at a shelter, you may come across breeds you have not heard of before. Our website makes it easy for you to find a shelter, review the current dog breeds up for adoption, and research the breed to find out more. Our goal is to redue the number of people shopping for dogs, increase the number of people adopting, and ensure your new pooch has a forever home with you! Researching breeds is the first step in insuring that you find the best dog to fit your life style.
