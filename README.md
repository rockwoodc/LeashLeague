# Leash League

## By The PUPaholics-- James Fraser, Cortland Finch, Christopher Campaigne, and Christian Rockwood

As devoted dog owners and lovers we wanted to make it simple for you to find your new fury bestfriend in a shelter near you. As we all know dogs can come in all shapes and sizes with different tempermeants and physical activity needs. This often makes it difficult for new potential dog owners to choose which breed they want or can have depending on their situation at home.We have created what we beleive is a great starting point in choosing your new companion. Our hope is to reduce or eliminate "shopping" for dogs and empty out our local shelters!
